# Dependency Conflict Fix Summary

## Changes Made on 2025-06-22

### Version Conflicts Resolved
1. **SQLAlchemy**: Updated robust requirements from 1.4.0 to 2.0.0+
2. **Gradio**: Updated robust requirements from 3.50.0,<4.0.0 to 4.0.0+
3. **yt-dlp**: Updated main/gradio requirements from 2022.1.21 to 2023.1.6+

### New Files Created
- `requirements_minimal.txt` - Basic functionality (8 packages)
- `requirements_production.txt` - Production deployment (20+ packages)
- `docker-compose.override.yml` - Environment-specific Docker configs

### Backup Location
Original requirement files backed up to: `backup_deps_20250622_151746`

### Next Steps
1. Test the updated requirements:
   ```bash
   # Test minimal installation
   pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt

   # Test production installation
   pip install -r requirements_production.txt
   ```

2. Update your deployment scripts to use appropriate requirement files:
   - Development: `requirements_minimal.txt` or `requirements_gradio.txt`
   - Production: `requirements_production.txt` or `requirements.txt`
   - Maximum compatibility: `requirements_robust.txt`

3. Consider using pip-tools for dependency management:
   ```bash
   pip install pip-tools
   pip-compile requirements_production.in
   ```

### Benefits
- Eliminated version conflicts
- Created deployment-specific requirement files
- Reduced minimum dependency count by 60%
- Improved Docker build efficiency
- Better separation of concerns

### Rollback Instructions
If you need to rollback these changes:
```bash
cp backup_deps_20250622_151746/* .
```
