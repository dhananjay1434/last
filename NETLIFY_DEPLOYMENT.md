# 🌐 Netlify Deployment Guide for Slide Extractor Frontend

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Access Netlify Dashboard
- Go to [https://netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
- Sign in with GitHub account
- Click **"Add new site"** → **"Import an existing project"**

### 2. Connect GitHub Repository
- Choose **"Deploy with GitHub"**
- Select repository: **`dhananjay1434/last`**
- Authorize Netlify access if prompted

### 3. Configure Build Settings
```
Site name: slide-extractor-frontend (or your preferred name)
Base directory: frontend
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: frontend/build
```

### 4. Environment Variables
Add these in **Site settings** → **Environment variables**:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL = https://slide-extractor-api.onrender.com
```
*(Replace with your actual backend URL)*

### 5. Deploy
- Click **"Deploy site"**
- Wait 2-3 minutes for build completion
- Site will be live at: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to **Site settings** → **Domain management**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions

### Build Optimization
Add these build settings for better performance:
```
Build command: npm run build && npm run optimize
Publish directory: frontend/build
Node version: 18
```

### Environment Variables for Different Stages
```
# Production
REACT_APP_API_URL = https://slide-extractor-api.onrender.com

# Staging (if you have a staging backend)
REACT_APP_API_URL = https://slide-extractor-staging.onrender.com

# Development
REACT_APP_API_URL = http://localhost:5000
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. Build Fails
**Error**: `npm: command not found`
**Solution**: Ensure Node.js version is set correctly
```
# In netlify.toml or build settings:
NODE_VERSION = 18
```

#### 2. API Connection Issues
**Error**: CORS or network errors
**Solution**: 
- Check `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable
- Ensure backend CORS allows your Netlify domain
- Verify backend is deployed and accessible

#### 3. Routing Issues
**Error**: 404 on page refresh
**Solution**: Add redirect rules in `frontend/public/_redirects`:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

#### 4. Environment Variables Not Working
**Error**: API URL shows as undefined
**Solution**: 
- Ensure variable name starts with `REACT_APP_`
- Redeploy after adding environment variables
- Check browser console for actual values
